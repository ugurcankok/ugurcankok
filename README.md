## Hi 👋   I'm Ugurcan 👨🏽‍💻
### Full Stack Developer at [KolayBi'](https://www.kolaybi.com)

I am a Computer Engineer. I graduated from Aydın Adnan Menderes University Computer Engineering and I am currently a Master of Computer Engineering student at Izmir Institute of Technology. I live in Aydın. I'm interested in artificial intelligence sub-branches.

My love of mathematics drove me towards computer engineering. I met data science thanks to my undergraduate education. I take firm steps forward in this wide-ranging journey, even if it is small.
